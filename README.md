A quick building of a coffeeshopinside Triple ten library. Created a simple reservation ,menu and contact set up for the school.Easy navigation across the entire webpage with clear understanding on finding the information needed to have best experince at the coffeeshop.

To improve project i would create a better menu display to make it standout a little bit more, would add pictures for more flare to make people desire the coffee more.
